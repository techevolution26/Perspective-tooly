App Concept
The application, inspired by platforms like Twitter, is designed to share "Perspectives" instead of traditional "Comments." The key features include:
    • An input page for users to submit perspectives in the form of text, images, or GIFs.
    • A view/list page to display all submitted perspectives.
    • A dedicated "Perception" section where users can create new perspectives.

        ◦ Submitted data is stored in the app’s state and displayed dynamically.
    2. View/List Page:
        ◦ Displays all posted perspectives in chronological order.
        ◦ Each post shows text, media, and a timestamp.
Additional Features:

Workflow and Implementation
Initial Setup:
    • The app is built using React, with a structured component-based architecture.
    • Separate components were created for the Input and View pages to maintain modularity.
Input Page Implementation:
    • A form is provided for users to input text or upload media.
    • On submission, a perspective object is created, including the content, media, and timestamp.
View/List Page Implementation:
    • Dynamically displays the list of perspectives using React state management.
    • Includes interactive buttons for liking, commenting, sharing, editing, and deleting posts.
State Management:
    • React’s useState is used to manage the state of perspectives.
    • Functions are passed as props to child components for seamless state updates.
Styling:
    • CSS is applied for layout and visual enhancements.
    • Specific styles ensure that buttons, media previews, and comments are user-friendly and visually appealing.
User Flow
    1. Post Creation:
        ◦ Users write text or upload media using the input form.
        ◦ Clicking "Post" submits the data, which is immediately displayed on the view page.
    2. Post Interaction:
        ◦ Users can like, comment, share, edit, or delete posts from the view page.
    3. Real-Time Updates:
        ◦ All interactions update the view page dynamically without requiring a page refresh.
Key Components
    1. Input Component:
        ◦ Handles text and media input.
        ◦ Includes validation to ensure proper content submission.
    2. View Component:
        ◦ Displays the list of perspectives.
        ◦ Manages actions like liking, commenting, sharing, editing, and deleting posts.
Future Plans
    • Authentication:
        ◦ Integrate user authentication to personalize experiences and secure content.
    • Enhanced Media Handling:
        ◦ Allow video uploads and better media previews.
    • Scalability:
        ◦ Optimize the app for handling large datasets with features like lazy loading and caching.
